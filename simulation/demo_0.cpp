// The purpose of this demo is to show how the MD Simulator works and to test whether it is working correctly.
// Treat it both as a tutorial and a set of tests.

// Test 1: Create a singe atom with no initial velocity. Watch it not move for 100 timesteps.


// // Create a single atom



// Test 2: Create a single atom with an initial velocity. Watch it move in a straight line at a constant velocity.

// Test 3: Create a two atoms. Fire one at the other. 

// Test 4: Create a FCC crystal lattice and watch it be stable. No intiial velocities.

// Test 5: Create a FCC crystal lattice and fire a slow moving particle at it. Watch it remain stable

// Test 6: Create a FCC crystal lattice and fire a fast moving particle at it. Watch it explode.
