Priority:
Create a gui that has three functions: Allows for easy simulation initialisation, controls playback of simulation, allows for simulation parameters to change on the fly.



Feature Creep:
Hide crystalline sections to show relevant parts of animation
Multiple types of atoms
Multiple species interactions
Cluster impacts
thermostat (control speed (and therefore kinetic energy) of structure to fit a specific temperature.)

Pipeline goal:
Create AI chatbot that guides the user to learning about molecular dynamics through conversation (interesting conversation ideally)
