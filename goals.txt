Goal 1: Animation (main) thread is slow. Make it so that the program can update the animation in a way that allows
for many atoms (Hopefully > 100k)

Goal 1.5: Finish report

Goal 2: Create a GUI that allows the user to change any parameter on the fly. The simulation msut be changed to update the 
simulation data in both forwards and backwards directions based on changes to parameters

Goal 3: Add additonal features:
Hide crystalline sections to show relevant parts of animation
Multiple types of atoms
Multiple species interactions
Cluster impacts
thermostat (control speed (and therefore kinetic energy) of structure to fit a specific temperature.)

Goal 4: Create AI chatbot that guides the user to learning about molecular dynamics through conversation (interesting conversation ideally)
